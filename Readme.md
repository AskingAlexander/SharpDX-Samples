# SharpDX Samples

This repository contains more than 100+ code samples using [SharpDX](http://sharpdx.org) ([github](https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX))

The purpose of these samples is to give a grasp of each API/platform and how to access DirectX API from C#.


> Disclaimer:
> - Quality of all code samples here are not meant for production (precisely, all code for Dispose() on COM objects is not always written while this is critical for production)
> - Samples are not exhaustive and not meant to demonstrate all DirectX API usages but only how to access DirectX from C#
>
